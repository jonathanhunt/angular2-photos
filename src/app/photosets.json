Wednesday, May 19th we were back on the road, briefly visiting the <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/apis/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Apostle Islands National Lakeshore</a> in Bayfield, Wisconsin.  Thursday, May 20th was a treat as we visited several stops in the beautiful upper peninsula of Michigan - <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/piro/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore</a>, <a href=\"http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,1607,7-153-10365_10887-124495--,00.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tahquamenon Falls State Park</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.mackinacisland.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mackinac Island</a>.

          "_content": "Brent and I took a trip out to the Grand Circle region from June 4th, 2004 - June 12th, 2004.  We flew into Las Vegas late on June 3rd (and completely ignored the city), then drove to Hoover Dam the next day.  We also stopped at the <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/grca/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Grand Canyon</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/nabr/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Natural Bridges National Monument</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/arch/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Arches National Park</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/cany/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Canyonlands National Park</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/care/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Capitol Reef National Park</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/brca/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bryce Canyon National Park</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/cebr/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cedar Breaks National Monument</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/zion/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zion National Park</a>.  It was one of the most incredible trips I have ever been on, and we certainly got our money's worth for our National Parks pass!  This trip was also the first real test for my new D70, and it passed with flying colors!"
